*ProtoCentral VL53L0X Laser ToF sensor breakout (PC-SEN-2001)*](https://www.protocentral.com/motiondistance/1049-protocentral-vl53l0x-laser-tof-sensor-breakout.html)

ST's VL53L0X is a 940 nm Laser source and a detector built in to the same chip. The result is a high accuracy Laser ranging sensor. 

This breakout board (along with the Arduino libraries) from ProtoCentral make it easier to do quick prototypes for applications that require precision ranging. Applications include obstacle detection and gesture recognition, among others. We have even used these for non-invasive liquid level detection. 

This device is a Class 1 Laser device, so is classified "Eye-safe", meaning it will not burn your corneas out !

Arduino Quickstart
------------------

* Download the [ProtoCentral VL53L0X library here](releases/download/v1.0/protocentral_vl53l0x.zip).

*Once downloaded, unzip the ZIP archive and copy the folder to your "libraries" folder in the Arduino Sketchbook folder. It is usually located in:

	* On MAC: <user_home>/Documents/Arduino/libraries
	* On Windows: <user_home>/My Documents/Arduino/libraries
	* On Linux: /home/<user_name>/sketchbook  

* After the libraries are copied, you can open the example code from File->Examples->protocentral_vl53l0x->simple_distance

* Arduino boards connections

You can connect the vl53l0x board to your Arduino through the following pins

| Arduino | VL53L0X board |
| ------- | ------------- |
| 5V      | VIN |
| GND     | GND |
| SDA     | SDA |
| SCL     | SCL |
        
Using Processing - Data Visualization Software
